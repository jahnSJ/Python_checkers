# Python_checkers

A python project in which I used [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to program the game [checkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkers).
This whole project is still work in progress. So everything in this repository is still subject to change.
I will try to improve the game and the graphics in due time.

# Installation

Follow the instructions listed in [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) then under windows you should be able to execute the program by double clicking on the game_start.bat file.

Under a Linux distribution it is necessary to start the ./main.py from the terminal after installing the pygame library.

# Graphics
The graphics were designed by me using [krita](https://krita.org/en/).
